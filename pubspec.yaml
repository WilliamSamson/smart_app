# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: Assets/Fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
        - asset: Assets/Fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf

   ##           weight: 500
    #        - asset: lib/Assets/Fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf
  #            weight: 700
  #          - asset: Assets/Fonts/Roboto-Light.ttf
      #        weight: 500
  #          - asset: Assets/Fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
     - Assets/Fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
     - images/
     - res/
     - images/logo.png
     - images/list.png
  #  - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #  - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:

  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic


  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
